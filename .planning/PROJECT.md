# Vibe Onepage

## What This Is

A drag-and-drop single-page website builder SaaS. Users select a template (Blog, Resume, Personal Intro, etc.), optionally use AI to generate a personalized site from an image + text description, then edit and publish to a hosted subdomain. Some templates are free, others paid per-use or via VIP subscription.

**Target users:** Non-technical individuals who want a personal website quickly — job seekers, freelancers, small business owners, bloggers.

## Core Value

Users can have a beautiful, personalized website live in minutes — not hours — by combining AI-assisted generation with an intuitive block-level editor.

## Current Milestone: v1.8 Editor Fixes

**Goal:** Fix critical editor bugs and add drafts functionality.

**Target features:**
- Editor text input works
- Template images reset on new session
- Done button saves user's actual edits
- Draft box on profile page
- Draft auto-save

## Previous Milestone: v1.6 UI Polish (COMPLETE)

**Shipped features:**
- White/light theme for all pages (Home, Editor, Templates, Analytics, etc.)
- Blue-black color scheme for buttons and components
- Editor UX improvements (block handles with selection state, config panel, smooth drag animations)
- Consistent hover animations on all interactive elements

## Context

**v1.0 shipped:** 2026-03-21. Full-stack SaaS with React + Spring Boot, AI generation, WeChat Pay, PDF export, Redis caching, RabbitMQ async processing.

**Tech stack:**
- Frontend: React 18 + Vite + TailwindCSS + TypeScript
- Backend: Spring Boot 3 + MyBatis-Plus + MySQL 8
- Cache/Queue: Redis + RabbitMQ
- Auth: JWT (7-day access, 30-day refresh)
- Payments: WeChat Pay
- AI: MiniMax via Spring AI OpenAI-compatible client

**Deployment:**
- Development: localhost ports (frontend 5173, backend 8080)
- Production: Docker containers on Tencent Cloud via BT Panel

**AI Integration:**
- Provider: MiniMax API
- Use cases: RGB color extraction, text generation, block content generation
- Workflow: ColorThief client-side extraction → Spring AI generation → block assembly

## Constraints

- **Tech stack**: Spring Boot + React (existing — do not change)
- **AI provider**: MiniMax (specified by user)
- **Domain**: No domain yet; use localhost ports in dev, swap domain later
- **Budget**: Low-cost operation; keep infrastructure minimal
- **Timeline**: Hot endpoints must handle 500 QPS (verified with JMeter)

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Block-level drag-and-drop | Simpler UX than free-layout; faster to implement | ✓ Validated — editor shipped in v1.0 |
| MiniMax for AI | User-specified provider | ✓ Working — color extraction + text gen |
| dnd-kit for drag-and-drop | Standard React DnD library, well-supported | ✓ Working — sortable blocks |
| Zustand with temporal middleware | Lightweight state + built-in undo/redo | ✓ Working — undo/redo confirmed |
| Flying Saucer for PDF | Java HTML-to-PDF, good CSS support | ✓ Shipped — async PDF generation |
| Redis caching 24h TTL | Cache template listing and blog pages | ✓ Validated — reduces DB load |
| HikariCP 50 connections | Appropriate for MySQL SSD at 500 QPS | ✓ Configured — ready for load test |
| RabbitMQ async processing | PDF/AI are slow (5-60s); must not block | ✓ Verified — consumers active |
| JMeter for load testing | Industry standard, scripted testing | ✓ Test plans created |
